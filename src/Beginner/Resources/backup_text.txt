Consider the following while backing up:


1. Be sure to display the message of success after completing the backup. Otherwise there is a problem. Try again
2. No error should be displayed when backing up. An error means no backups
3. Be sure to back up the information at different times. In any circumstances and at any time, the responsibility for the loss of information is at your own risk


Warning: Before you change Windows and remove the program, be sure to  copy the installation folder and keep it safe.
